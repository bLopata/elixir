## Erlang, Elixir, and OTP

[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) is a dynamic, functional programming language designed for building scalable and highly available applications. Elixir leverages the Erlang VM the lastest version of which uses BEAM (aka the new BEAM) Bogdan/BjÃ¶rn's Erlang Abstract Machine which was developed by two engineers who worked at Ericcson. BEAM is the virtual machine at the core of the Open Transfer Protocol (OTP) which is in turn part of the Erlang Run-Time System (ERTS) which compiles Erlang/Elixir to bytecode to be executed on the BEAM.

## [Basic types in Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/basic-types.html "Elixir Lang - Basic Types")

```elixir
1          # integer
0x1F       # integer
1.0        # float
true       # boolean
:atom      # atom / symbol
'hello'    # charlist
"elixir"   # string
[1, 2, 3]  # list
{1, 2, 3}  # tuple
%{1=> :ok, # map
2=> "a",
3=> [1, 2, 3]}
```

The heirarchy of types in elixir is as follows:

<pre><code>number < atom < reference < function < port < pid < tuple < map < list < bitstring</pre></code>

```elixir
iex> 1 < :an_atom
true
```

Data types in Elixir are immutable, and any operation performed on a list, for example, create another list rather than modifying the existing list.

## [Operators](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.6.4/operators.html#content "Hex Docs - Operators")

### Comparison operators

<code>
<ul>
<li>==  # equality
<li>!=  # inequality
<li>=== # strict equality
<li>!== # strict inequality
<li>>   # greater than
<li><   # less than
<li><=  # less than equal to
<li>>=  # greater than equal to
</code>

### Boolean and negation operators

<code>
<li>or
<li>and
<li>not
<li>!
</code>

### Arithmetic operators

<code>
<li>+ 
<li>- 
<li>*
<li>/
</code>

Join operators
<> and ++, as long as the left side is a literal
The in operator
Membership in a collection or range

### Unused operators

The following are unused operators which are valid in Elixir

<li>|
<li>|||
<li>&&&
<li><<<
<li>>>>
<li>~>>
<li><<~
<li>~>
<li><~
<li><~>
<li><|>
<li>^^^
<li>~~~

It is possible to bind these operators as well as rebind used operators in Elixir to a custom definition.

```elixir
defmodule WrongMath do
  # Let's make math wrong by changing the meaning of +:
  def a + b, do: a - b
end
```

(_Note: to avoid ambiguity and an error, if rebinding a defined operator, you **must** exclude the associated `[fun: arity]` from the module import._)

```elixir
iex> import WrongMath
iex> import Kernel, except: [+: 2]
```

## Modules

## Functions

Functions in Elixir are defined by their name and their arity (number of input arguments).

The shorthand for a function representation is the function named, followed by a slash and the arity of the function

```elixir
IO.puts/1
```

### Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions are also permitted in Elixir. Anonymous functions are delimeted by the keywords `fn` and `end`, e.g.

```elixir
iex> add = fn a, b -> a + b end
#Function<12.71889879/2 in :erl_eval.expr/5>
iex> add.(1, 2)
3
```

The arguments are listed to the left of the arrow operator and the code to be executed to the right. The anonymous function is stored in the variable `add`. Note the dot (`.`) is required to call an anonymous function. The dot defines the difference between an anonymous function matched to a variable `add` and a named function `add/2`.

Calling `is_function/2` with the name and arity of the function will return a boolean for the existence of the named function.

### Default Parameters

When defining a function, you can specify a default value to any of the parameters by using

```
param \\ value
```

Elixir compares the number of given parameters in a function call to the number of required parameters (from left to right) and will override default value if the number of parameters in a function call is greater than the number of required parameters.

```elixir
@doc"""
Erroneous functions with multiple heads having default parameters.
"""
defmodule Params do
    def func(p1, p2 \\ 123), do: IO.inspect [p1, p2]

    def func(p1, 99), do: IO.puts "you said 99"
end
```

Results in the following error:

```
warning: definitions with multiple clauses and default values require a header. Instead of:

    def foo(:first_clause, b \\ :default) do ... end
    def foo(:second_clause, b) do ... end

one should write:

    def foo(a, b \\ :default)
    def foo(:first_clause, b) do ... end
    def foo(:second_clause, b) do ... end

def func/2 has multiple clauses and defines defaults in one or more clauses
  func_module.exs:4

warning: variable "p1" is unused
  func_module.exs:4

warning: this clause cannot match because a previous clause at line 2 always matches
```

Instead, you should add a function head with no body which contains the default paramters, followed by function(s) using regular parameters.

```elixir
defmodule Params do

    def func(p1, p2 \\ 123)

    def func(p1, p2) when is_list(p1) do
        "You said #{p2} with a list"
    end

    def func(p1, p2), do: "You passed #{p1} and #{p2}"

end
```

### Capture function (&)

The capture function in Elixir is a shortcut which can accomplish one of two things:

- capture a function with a given name and arity from a module which is a handy shorthand to bind a function from a built in module to a local name
- or it be used to create anonymous functions

```elixir
sayHello = &(IO.puts/1)
sayHello.("hi there) # binds the IO.puts() method to a local name
```

This example shows binding a function (`IO.puts()`) to a locally scoped name (`sayHello`)

```elixir
defmodule Issues.TableFormatter do
    def make_columnar_table(data_by_colums, format) do
        Enum.each(data_by_colums, &put_in_one_row/1)
    end

    def put_in_one_row(fields) do
        # do something else
    end
end
```

In this example, both functions are in the same module, so you do not need to specify the module name as with `IO.puts()`.

```elixir
add_one = &(1 + 1)
add_one.(1) # 2
```

This is an example of using capture to create an anonymous function. The above can be written out more formally as:

```elixir
add_one = fn x -> x + 1 end
add_one.(1) # 2
```

The `&1` is known as a **value placeholder**, which identifies the *n*th argument of the function.

Additionally, lists ({} and []) are also operators in elixir, so the value placeholder and capture function works within them as well.

```elixir
return_list = &[&1, 2]
return_list.(1, 2) # [1, 2]

return_tuple = &{&1, 2}
return_tuple.(1, 2) # {1, 2}
```
